# Camagru

Camagru is a containerized full-stack web application inspired by the 42 school project. It allows users to capture or upload images, overlay stickers, and publish them to a public gallery. Authenticated users can like and comment on images. All backend logic is written in Ruby using Sinatra, and image processing is handled server-side.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Ruby, Sinatra
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
* **Email**: MailHog (SMTP), `mail` gem
* **Image Processing**: Server-side overlay pipeline (TBD)
* **Authentication**: JWT-based session tokens
* **Tests**: RSpec
* **Linting**: RuboCop
* **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

## 📦 Running Locally

```bash
make up         # Start containers
make migrate    # Run DB migrations
make seed       # Seed DB with test data
make logs       # Tail backend logs
```

---

## 🧰 Utilities

* `make docs` — export Markdown + JSON API documentation
* `rake db:create|drop|migrate|seed` — DB tasks
* `rake doc:export` — custom task for `APIDoc` generator

---

## 📌 Notes

* All images returned from `/gallery`, `/images/mine`, and `/images/archived` include embedded `comments` and `likes`.
* Pagination supports `page`, `per_page`, `sort_by` (`created_at`, `likes`, `comments`), and `order` (`asc`, `desc`).
* Email delivery is mocked with MailHog by default.

---

## 🏁 Remaining Work

* [x] Implement server-side image processing pipeline (stickers overlay)
* [x] Add frontend integration
* [ ] Rate limiting for likes/comments/images
* [x] User profile editing
